# E-commerce Product Listing Page

This is a React-based e-commerce plants product listing page built. It displays a list of products, allows users to add items to the cart, and provides pagination to navigate through multiple product listings. Users can also view a modal for confirming product additions to the cart.

## Features

- **Product List**: Displays a list of products with details like name, description, rating, price, and image.
- **Add to Cart**: Users can add products to the cart, with a modal popup for confirmation.
- **View Product**: Users can navigate to a custom 'Thank You' page when they click the "View Product" button.
- **Pagination**: Allows users to navigate between pages of product listings.
- **Nursery Section**: Displays a separate list of nurseries with a grid layout.

## Demo

You can access the live demo of the project on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS Amplify once deployed.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **React Router**: Used for navigation between the pages (e.g., product list, cart, and thank you page).
- **React Hooks**: Used for managing state (e.g., modal open/close state, cart management).
- **CSS**: Custom CSS for styling the components.
- **Figma**: Design mockup used for creating the UI components.
- **Mock Data**: Sample product and nursery data used to populate the product listing.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AadhiVenkatesh/Plants-e-commerce.git
   cd frontend



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
